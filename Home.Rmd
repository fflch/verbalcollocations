This dictionary is the result of over 30 years collecting verbal
collocations from various sources as can be seen from the references of
the examples. When there are no references, they were retrieved from one
of Mark Davies´s English and Portuguese corpora.

The dictionary offers no definitions but the examples were chosen so as
to make the meaning clear.

It is still a work in progress -- dictionaries are never complete! -- so
there may be entries for which no equivalent or example is provided.
Contributions are welcome. If you have any suggestions, please contact
me.
